To use the node, add it to your workflow and setup a new credential.
![alt text](<docs/auth-node-new-credentails.png>)

Enter your Client ID, Client Secret and API key obtained from the Investec Portal
![alt text](<docs/auth-node-enter-credentials.png>)

**NOTE**: Nodes do not refresh an expired token. You will need to do this manually in your workflows

## Compatibility

Developed and tested using n8n version 1.111.0

## Usage

![alt text](docs/basic-workflow.png)

Basic requirements for using the nodes is that you need to first get an access token using the Auth node. After that the token can be passed to the other nodes to execute different [operations](#operations)
